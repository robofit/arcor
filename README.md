# ARCOR (formerly known as arcor) - the main repository

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robofit/arcor.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/robofit/arcor)

ARCOR - vision of a near future workspace, where human and robot may safely and effectively collaborate. Our main focus is on human-robot interaction and especially on robot programming - to make it feasible for any ordinary skilled worker. The interaction is based mainly on interactive spatial augmented reality - combination of projection and touch sensitive surface. However, more modalities are integrated or currently under development.

### Repositories / packages

This repository holds the main components of the system, which are not specific to any particular setup (combination and type of components) or robot:

 * [art_brain](https://github.com/robofit/arcor/tree/master/art_brain) - central node which communicates with robot, manages program execution, holds current system state etc.
 * [art_bringup](https://github.com/robofit/arcor/tree/master/art_bringup) - to launch the system.
 * [art_calibration](https://github.com/robofit/arcor/tree/master/art_calibration) - AR marker-based mutual calibration of cameras.
 * [art_collision_env](https://github.com/robofit/arcor/tree/master/art_collision_env) - manages detected as well as artificial objects within the workspace.
 * [art_db](https://github.com/robofit/arcor/tree/master/art_db) - permanent storage for object types, programs, etc.
 * [art_instructions](https://github.com/robofit/arcor/tree/master/art_instructions) - for each supported instruction there is its definition in yaml and respective classes for art_brain and art_projected_gui. Those classes are loaded on startup based on ```/art/instructions``` parameter.
 * [art_led](https://github.com/robofit/arcor/tree/master/art_led) - RGB LED strip interface.
 * [art_projected_gui](https://github.com/robofit/arcor/tree/master/art_projected_gui) - shows system state, allows to set program parameters, etc. 
 * [art_projector](https://github.com/robofit/arcor/tree/master/art_projector) - calibrates projector wrt. Kinect and displays scene generated by art_projected_gui. 
 * [art_simple_tracker](https://github.com/robofit/arcor/tree/master/art_simple_tracker) - not a real tracker, it "tracks" objects based on already assigned IDs and performs position/orientation filtering from multiple detectors.
 * [art_sound](https://github.com/robofit/arcor/tree/master/art_sound) - a sound interface: plays sound for selected system events (error).
 * [art_table_pointing](https://github.com/robofit/arcor/tree/master/art_table_pointing) - uses Kinect skeleton tracking to compute where user points on the table.
 * [art_touch_driver](https://github.com/robofit/arcor/tree/master/art_touch_driver) - reads data from touch foil (which is HID device) a publishes it as ROS messages.

Additional repositories:

 * [arcor-msgs](https://github.com/robofit/arcor-msgs) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robofit/arcor-msgs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robofit/arcor-msgs) - ROS messages, services, actions.
 * [arcor-utils](https://github.com/robofit/arcor-utils) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robofit/arcor-utils.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robofit/arcor-utils) - Python helper classes.
 * [arcor-detectors](https://github.com/robofit/arcor-detectors) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robofit/arcor-detectors.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robofit/arcor-detectors) - detectors (currently, only AR code detector wrapper).

For each integrated robot, there are two repositories: one with custom packages providing high-level functions compatible with arcor ROS API and one with implementation of art_brain plugin (```-interface``` one):

Currently supported setups (see links for further information):

 Any supported setup may be used with any supported robot (or even without one).

### Functionality

The system has two main modes: setting program parameters and program execution.

The video below briefly introduces the system and shows how we did its first UX testing:

[![arcor video](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cQqNLy6mE8w/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQqNLy6mE8w)

Currently, the robot program has to be created beforehand (e.g. using script like [this](https://github.com/robofit/arcor/blob/master/art_db/scripts/simple_trolley.py). Then, program parameters could be easily set using the projected interface. In order to make setting parameters as simple as possible, the system is based on complex instructions, with high-level of abstraction (for supported instructions see [instructions.yaml](https://github.com/robofit/arcor/blob/master/art_instructions/config/instructions.yaml)).

### API

All topics, parameters and services can be found in `/art` namespace.
